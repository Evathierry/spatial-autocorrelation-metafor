# spatial-autocorrelation-metafor

Dear all,


Does someone know how to take into account spatial autocorrelation in a meta-analysis with the metafor R package ?

I work on fish abundance data and associated diversity metrics at 35 stations located along several large French rivers (Rh√¥ne, Vienne, Loire, Meuse, Seine).
Some of the stations are closer than others : for example, 7 stations are located in the same area (distance <10 km) while some of them are located in different catchments without direct connectivity. Consequently, I expect that my data/results will be strongly spatially autocorrelated.

Initially
I am looking for a way to correct the time series meta-analysis for this spatial heterogeneity in R. Ideally, I was thinking of a method that would allow the weighting of the different time series in the meta-analysis according to their relative distance along the river network.


##########  What I've performed for the moment #############

TAB_AnnBio3 #Main table with the different species abundances and diversity metrics (~1000 lines and ~60 columns)
library(metafor)
library(Kendall)
library(boot)

## [OFF] Computation of regression coefficient using Mann-Kendall trend analyses (Hamed & Rao 1998)
ri_S # correlation coefficient of the 35 study sites (lines) and 60 species/metrics (columns)
VarSi # Variance extracted from the trend analysis (35 lines / 60 colunms)

## Example with the metric i = 43 (total abundance)
# Version 1 - without weighting the study sites
  i=43
  ri.final_MD1 = rma(yi = ri_S[,i], vi = VarSi[,i], measure = "GEN")

# Version 2 - Weighting the study sites according to proximity groups (the 35 study sites can be grouped according to 11 "areas") --> a first step into considering spatial links between study sites
  vec_W # vector of weigths (length = 35)
  i=43
  ri.final_MD2 = rma(yi = ri_S[,i], vi = VarSi[,i], measure = "GEN", weights = vec_W)



########## What I would like to do : take into account spatial autocorrelation with a distance matrix  #########

I have a distance matrix like this ; 

# #TAB_DIST_STA7 # Distance matrix in km ; 10000 = disconnected sites (different catchments)

#             STA1        STA2       STA3       STA4      STA5       STA6        STA7       STA8      STA9    
# STA1        0           6          10000      10000     10000      10000       10000      10000     10000  
# STA2        6           0          10000      10000     10000      10000       10000      10000     10000
# STA3        10000       10000      0          1         1          6           11         11        13  
# STA4        10000       10000      1          0         1          5           10         10        12  
       
 
I have though about the function "rma.mv" of the "metafor" package to try to account for spatial autocorrelation. 
I supposed that I should use the 'R' and 'random' arguments because these arguments can be used in a situation where there is a correlation induced by a phylogenetic history among organisms, which could be perhaps considered as a similar issue (except that it's not about a phylogenetic distance but a geographic distance).
For more on the rma.mv function, you can refer to this document https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/metafor.pdf (p.207 see 'random' and 'R' arguments)

Maybe something like that ? 

i=43
ri.mv_MD3 = rma.mv(yi = ri_S[,i], V = VarSi[,i], random = ~ 1 | STA, data=ri_S, R = list (STA = TAB_DIST_STA7))


Can anyone help me ?
